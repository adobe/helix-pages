# Helix Doc to Markdown

Those files make up the 'google script' that is executed when helix fetches the markdown of a
google document. Alternatively, the entire markdown conversion could be handled in an 
Adobe I/O runtime action by accessing the google drive API directly. The nice thing about using
a google script is that the entire authentication is handled by the cloud platform.
