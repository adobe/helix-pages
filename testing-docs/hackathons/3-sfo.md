### Goal

> What are you planning to show at the end of the week?

* @simonwex and the Developer Relations team, responsible for the new developer website, created several topics they want to cover - see https://github.com/adobe/Adobe-Developer-Site/labels/helix%20hackathon
* The Helix core team needs to address at least one important topic: upgradability / CI/CD for production.
* Gather ideas, opinions and requirements for a possible Helix authoring (and admin) UX


@stefan-guggisberg wants to remove native `nodegit` from `helix-cli`'s dependency graph, see https://github.com/adobe/git-server/issues/47

We should finally come to a conclusion regarding potential export restrictions for the binary `hlx` distribution, see  https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli/issues/129
