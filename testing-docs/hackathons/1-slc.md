## First Project Helix Hackathon

### Date

June 4-8 2018

### Agenda

> I hear this is a hackathon, are you going to hack all day?

Although this is a hackathon, we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty of programming and coding.

### Location

> Where is this going to happen? Do you have a windowless conference room blocked out?

At the [Salt Lake City Public Library, main branch](https://www.slcpl.org/about). Booking flights in and out of SLC and a hotel in Salt Lake City is a good bet.

> [210 East 400 South](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Salt+Lake+City+Public+Library/@40.7599247,-111.8870789,17z)
> Salt Lake City, UT 84111 

We are in "meeting room 3", the room number is 331, on third floor.

### Goal

> What are you planning to show at the end of the week?

Our current prototype (Primordial Soup) has only dummy content and dummy designs and dummy components. The goal of the Hackathon is to take the next stage of evolution: get a site live that has content like [helpx.adobe.com](https://helpx.adobe.com) and a modern, mobile-first design inspired by [helpx.adobe.com](https://helpx.adobe.com). For the Hackathon, we are going to assume that all content is authored directly in Markdown on GitHub.

A couple of things we want to validate are:

- nontrivial content authoring on GitHub
- nontrivial content delivery using Helix
- responsive content using Helix
- development set-up and experience when building Helix components
