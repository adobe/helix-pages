# How to Helix

In a few easy steps you’ll have made a website using a google drive document. 

### Google Drive

Create a new Google Drive Folder

Make a new doc titled “index” inside the folder

Share the folder with [helix.integration@gmail.com](mailto:helix.integration@gmail.com) and copy the url for you to use in github in the next step.

### Github



Create a new repository e.g. “howtohelix”

Add a new file to your currently empty repo by selecting the **creating a new file** link in the top section, title it fstab.yaml, and commit these two lines of code inside:



```
mountpoints:
  /: URL to your Google Folder
```



Remember to paste the URL you copied from your google folder in the second line, see example image of what it should look like

### THE END

It’s ready, already.



In your browser, navigate to:



```
(github repo name)-(github user name).hlx.page
```



So in the case of this demo, that’s:  
[howtohelix-spenhar.hlx.page](https://howtohelix-spenhar.hlx.page/)

P.S.

-   Use 4 spaces before a line of text for code formatting
-   Insert Horizontal Line directly above and below an image in your document to have a full-screen image divider.
-   Try using all the text size presets in the dropdown - Title, subtitle, Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.

### You’re still here?

You must be a bit more advanced than this single page thing. You want a header and a footer? Okay okay let’s do that next.
