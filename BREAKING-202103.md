# Breaking Changes 2021-03

This branch is a test to see how specific versions of helix services can be selected
in order to give a preview of upcoming breaking changes.

## How to publish

**DON'T PUBLISH TO THE REAL PAGES Service** (yet)

## Example Request

- https://breaking-202103--theblog--adobe.hlx.page/

## Selected Services

# TODO:

- how to version pages. eg: `4.15.4.202103-1`
- add simple mechanism to tag some PRs in order to get a stable CI version.
- add a tool to collect/update tagged services
